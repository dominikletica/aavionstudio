Status: Draft  
Updated: 2025-10-29

Use this section to document high-level architecture concerns.

Suggested topics:

- Persistence layer (Doctrine, SQLite dual DB setup)
- Snapshot pipeline architecture
- Resolver pipeline internals
- Media storage & delivery

Sub-guides should live in separate Markdown files within this directory.

# Feat: User Management & Access Control (P0 | Scope: L)

**Status:** Draft â€“ details may be refined during implementation.  
**Objective:** Provide authentication, role-based authorisation, and fine-grained ACLs across core and modular features.

## Functional Requirements
- User accounts with password-based login (Symfony Security) and optional 2FA (future phase).
- Role hierarchy (`ROLE_VIEWER`, `ROLE_EDITOR`, `ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`) plus feature-scoped permissions.
- ACL policies that map module capabilities (e.g., Exporter, Relation Manager) to roles.
- Session management with remember-me support; enforce secure cookies and CSRF protection for all forms/actions.
- API keys per user with scopes for read/write operations.

## Architecture Overview
- Security bundle configured with user provider backed by `app_user` table (ULID id, email, password hash, profile JSON, locale).
- Permission registry: modules register capabilities (`content.publish`, `export.run`) via manifest; installer seeds roles with defaults.
- Middleware:
  - Voters for entity-level access (draft ownership, project membership).
  - Route attributes for capability checks (`#[IsGranted('export.run')]`).
- Password reset flow: signed URLs + token storage in `system.brain`.

## Admin UI
- `/admin/users` module (core) lists accounts, role assignments, API keys.
- Form-driven editor with validation, optional invitation emails.
- Audit log integration: record login attempts, role changes, API key creation.

## API & Integrations
- Bearer API keys for programmatic access; hashed storage with last-used metadata.
- OAuth2 / SSO left for future module; design interfaces to allow pluggable user providers.
- Webhooks triggerable per module (e.g., notifier for failed login).

## Implementation Milestones
1. User entity + Doctrine migration; password hasher config; login/logout controllers.
2. Role hierarchy + capability registry; integrate with module manifest loader.
3. Admin UI for accounts, API keys, role assignment.
4. ACL voters and unit tests covering project/content access scenarios.
5. Optional enhancements: 2FA, account lockout, session revocation.

## Decisions (2025-10-31)
- Add project memberships (`app_project_user`) layered over global roles so editors can be scoped per project without duplicating accounts.
- All role, capability, and API-key changes append to the audit log to guarantee traceability.
- SSO/OAuth ships later as pluggable authenticators; core release relies on password login with optional 2FA.
